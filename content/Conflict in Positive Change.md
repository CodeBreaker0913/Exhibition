So, imagine this, conflict's like a storm in your brain, 

All those thoughts you hide, driving you insane.

Fights and arguments, they persecute everyone ,

But not all conflicts like that, 

Only in case, if you are the clever one, 

Conflict can spark innovation in the workplace, 

Different ideas clashing, a creative space.

Through constructive conflict, new solutions emerge,

Pushing boundaries, making progress surge.

So, my friend, conflicts aren't always a curse,

They can bring about growth, they can be diverse.

Just like the Wright Brothers, dreaming and facing strife, 

Through conflict, they soared, changing lives with flight.

Now, let's shift focus to the world we share, 

Where conflict can expose what's not fair.

Whistleblowers, bold and brave in their quest, 

Speaking truth, raising their voices, no jest.

But listen up, friends, conflict ain't a breeze,

It's messy, uncomfortable, can bring you to your knees.

Yet, here's the deal, let it guide you through, 

Deal with it constructively, that's what you gotta do.

Don't attack personally, focus on the matter, 

Respectful discourse, that's how progress will scatter.

Find common ground, bridge that divide,

Winning arguments won't bring change worldwide.

So, when conflict comes knocking, don't run away,

Embrace it, see it as a chance to sway.

With conflict by our side, innovation will ignite, Injustice will crumble, truth shining bright.
