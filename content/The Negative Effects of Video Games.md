**Poor Sleep Hygiene**

Lots and lots of gamers don't get enough sleep nowadays. Its easy to lose track of time, especially when playing with other. You always can play "just one more game", which just leads to "just a little less sleep". 

Sleep deprivation is a terrible symptom and effects you in many ways, including but not limited to:
- Trouble Learning
- Focus Problems
- Reacting Issues
- Hard to judge other's emotions
- Frustration
- Crankiness
- Anxiety

When you start to lose sleep it effects other parts of your life too. You won't be able to focus during day in activities such as school, and work. Sleep is not just a recommendation, its a necessity for living a good and fulfilling life. You need to sleep between 7-9 hours per day. It is sad to see so many people playing games well into the night, losing out in so much sleep. It is impossible for them to function when you get barely or no sleep at all.

**Physical Health Atrophy**

Movement is essential for a human body to survive. If you don't move then you will suffer many side affects such as:
- Weight Gain
- Muscle Loss
- Stiff Joints
- Poor Posture
- Chronic Headaches
- Head and Back Pain

Obesity does have a relatively low correlation with gaming, but note that 1% of all gamers suffer from it. Obesity can also lead to heart problems and heart-related disorders.

Many Pro-Gamers had to retire because of these complications such as professional League of Legends player (of course its a LOL player), who had to retire because of his type 2 diabetes that he gained from his fatty diet and lack of exercise from excessive gaming.
